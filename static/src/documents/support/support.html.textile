*Wookiees*, although primitive compared to us, are surprisingly capable warriors. They're pretty strong, and pick up combat techniques pretty quickly. Learn more about these lovable rogues at "Wookiepedia(what a great name!)":http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wookiee.

Some hairy examples of this species are:

* Lowbacca
* Lumpawaroo
* Yubookoo
* Zaalbar
* Gumnought
